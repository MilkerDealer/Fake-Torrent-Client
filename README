This current version is ALPHA.

WHAT'S WORKING:
- Creating a client
- Edit settings
- Upload torrent files, select their current progress, their download speed range, their upload speed range, and selecting wheather to start them or not.
- Displaying the client, status, progress, size, total downloaded, total uploaded, download speed and upload speed (if present), seeders and leeachers
- DOWNLOAD a torrent and seed it WITHOUT fake-upload any data
- Save the client and settings to a json file
- Pickling the torrent objects so you could start\stop the client without losing any data


WHAT'S NOT:
- Changing the status of a torrent after adding it
- Editing the client from the web-ui
- Fake-upload data when seeding the torrent (it will seed 0kb the whole seeding time)


WHAT'S NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED:
- Cleaning up the code
- Improving the web ui - it's very broken (for example - it does not properly display the download speed, and it does not display properly the global download speed)
- Changing the web engine from flask's default to gunicorn

WHAT'S NEEDED TO BE ADDED:
- Console to display logs
- The option to edit torrents (for example - change the client), edit the clients
- The option to sort torrents in the web-ui
- The option to gracefully stop\start all torrents
- Multi selection for torrents
